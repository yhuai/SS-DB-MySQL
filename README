===================================================
REQUIREMENTS

- cmake 2.6
- reasonably latest libstdc/boost/etc.
- log4cxx
- MySQL Connector/C (not mysql++ for ideal performance)
see CMakeLists.txt for more details.

===================================================
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

Simply put everything under scidb_rdb. This program should be compact.

===================================================
CODING STYLE

I don't care.
basically 2-space (no tab) indent, orthodox style. You can object.

===================================================
ENVIRONMENT SPECIFIC FILES

Files named "xxx.template" are configuration files you should copy/rename
to "xxx" in your environment.

- connection.config.template: define MySQL servers to connect. the first row
is 'main' server which should be localhost.
